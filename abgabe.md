## Generating Code

We have written the code in the programming language Haskell.
You can find the code online on [GitHub](https://github.com/Simre1/sliding-puzzle-sat) or in the `generating-code.zip` file.

We have also included an executable in `executable.zip` which should work on most Linux x86 systems.
